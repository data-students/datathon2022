We wanted for the challenge presented by the Data Students Association to have more of a social goal, which could have a direct positive impact on people’s lives. In particular, we focused on the elderly, as it is a collective that is easily left out and not taken into account in our current society. 

Elder people encounter several difficulties and problems on a daily basis, and some of them could be solved or at least attenuated by taking advantage of the powers of technology and data science. New technologies can play a fundamental role in improving the quality of life of elderly people and extend their independence. This is specially crucial since the population is ageing and this segment of the population is getting more significant over the following years.

In fact, it is estimated that in Catalonia, by 2052, the number of people over 65 will reach 2.5 million, representing 29% of the total population, 10% more than now. In particular, people over 85 will represent more than two and a half times the current population. These older people will have education, full digital skill, leisure time and better health for much longer throughout their lives ([source](http://www.idescat.cat/pub/?id=proj)).

So, this challenge has as a goal tackling problems related to ageing applying data science. You can approach these problems either by performing descriptive and/or predictive data analysis, by proposing an innovative data-driven technological solution, or a combination of both approaches.

Take into account that your project does not necessarily have to help and be focused only on the elder people of the present, but it might also be helpful to those of the future too.

Some of the most important problems related to ageing on which you could base your proposal:
- Availability and accessibility to community and medical services
- Loneliness
- Mobility
- Health issues related to ageing
- Active ageing
- Digital divide

As we are in a datathon, all proposals must be data-driven, so we provide some public data sets that could be used for the challenge.
