								<p><span><strong>Alternate Title:</strong> ACTIVE, 1999-2001</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> ACTIVE (Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and
Vital Elderly), 1999-2001 [United States] was a multisite randomized
controlled trial conducted at six field sites with New England
Research Institutes (NERI) as the coordinating center. The field sites
included the University of Alabama at Birmingham, Hebrew Rehabilitation
Center for the Aged in Boston, Indiana University, Johns Hopkins
University in Baltimore, Pennsylvania State University, and the
University of Florida/Wayne State University (Detroit). The primary
aim of the trial was to test the effects of three distinct cognitive
interventions -- previously found to be successful in improving
elders' performance on basic measures of cognition under laboratory or
small-scale field conditions -- on measures of cognitively demanding
daily activities. Trainings consisted of an initial series of ten group
sessions followed by four-session booster trainings at one and three
years. The three cognitive interventions focused on memory, executive
reasoning, and speed of processing. The design included a no-contact
control group. Participants were assessed at baseline, immediately
after training, and annually thereafter. A total of 2,832 older adults
were enrolled in the trial, and 2,802 were included in the
analytical sample. Twenty-six percent of the participants were
African American.</span></p>

<li>AN1 -- 1st Annual Post-Test</li>

<li>UFOV -- Useful Field of Vision</li></ol>, <p>The Rey AVLT used in this data collection is a subset of the
full Rey test.</p>, <p>Only a particular subset of the Rivermead
Behavioral Memory Test was used for ACTIVE.</p>, The 10th Annual Post-Test of the ACTIVE study is also available from ICPSR (ICPSR 36036). Included in ICPSR 36036 is a newer version of the Analysis Dataset which includes data from the 10th Annual Post-Test as well as data from the previous tests. Users are advised that the ICPSR 36036 version of the Analysis Dataset may include updates to the earlier data and should consider using the newer version of this file for analyses., The title of this collection has been edited to conform to current metadata standards., Please note that there are some discrepancies in this collection that we are working to correct: the data files and the codebook for dataset 12 do not match; also, the codebook for dataset 10 appears to be duplicated. Users should contact icpsr-nacda@umich.edu if they discover additional errors.</span></p>
		        		<h2>Methodology:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Sample:</strong> The sample consisted of 2,832 persons aged 65 to 94
recruited from 6 metropolitan areas in the United States. The
University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) recruited participants from
residents of Jefferson County, Alabama, who were licensed to drive or who
possessed nondriver ID cards issued through the Alabama Department of
Public Safety, and they recruited from UAB eye clinics. The Hebrew
Rehabilitation Center for the Aged (HRCA) in Boston, Massachusetts, recruited from
congregate and senior housing sites, senior centers, and a registry of
volunteers for aging research at the Harvard Cooperative Program on
Aging. Indiana University recruited clients of the Community Centers
of Indianapolis and through local churches and senior organizations.
Johns Hopkins University recruited from senior centers, churches,
senior housing, and senior organizations in the Baltimore, Maryland, metropolitan
area and in Cumberland, Maryland. Pennsylvania State University recruited
from the enrollment files of a state-funded pharmaceutical assistance
program for low-income elders, called PACE. And Wayne State University
recruited from community organizations, churches, and senior housing
in metropolitan Detroit, as well as from state of Michigan driver registration
lists. The study design also included a no-contact control group.</span></p>

ICPSR also routinely creates ready-to-go data files along with setups in the major statistical software formats as well as standard codebooks to accompany the data. In addition to these procedures, ICPSR performed the following processing steps for this data collection:</p><ul><li>Performed consistency checks.</li><li>Standardized missing values.</li><li>Checked for undocumented or out-of-range codes.</li></ul></span></p>
